			<p>
			My name is Moises Gonzalez but all my friends call me Mo. I'm 27 years young and currently work for Kyocera. I've been
			working for Kyocera for about three years now. I am a Field Sales Manager covering the Southwest region and support and 
			Retail and B2B sales opportunities in Southern California, South Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. I am also a 
			hige fan and practitioner of Brazilian JiuJitsu. I enjoy the martial art becasue you never stop learning and are constatly
			learning something new. I would ultimatley love to obtain a black belt in Brazilian JiuJitsu. I am interested in Web Development
			because it's always been something I have had a interest and passion in. I hope you enjoyed learning a bit about me and enjoy my 
			portfolio.
